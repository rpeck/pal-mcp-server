# Open-model `intelligence_score` calibration

How the `intelligence_score` (the 1–20 signal that orders the `DEFAULT_MODEL=auto` menu and breaks
ties) was set for the 22 open-weight OpenRouter models added to `conf/openrouter_models.json`. The
scores were derived from current benchmark data and cross-checked by three models — **Opus 4.8 +
GPT-5.4 + Gemini-3.5-Flash**; both external reviewers signed off with no remaining changes. This
document records the reasoning so the numbers aren't a black box.

## Benchmark research (method & sources)

Data gathered **2026-06-01, HuggingFace-first**: model cards (MMLU-Pro, GPQA-Diamond, LiveCodeBench,
AIME, SWE-bench Verified & Pro). For API-only models not on HuggingFace (Qwen-Max, GLM, MiniMax,
Kimi), the **Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index** and **LMArena** Elo were used as a fallback,
labeled as such. Every model ID and served context window was verified against the live OpenRouter
`/api/v1/models` response (343 models).

The scale is an integer 1–20, **anchored to existing catalog entries**: `gpt-5.5`=20,
`gpt-5.1-codex`/`gemini-3.1-pro`=19, `gpt-5.2`=18, `gpt-5-pro`=17 · `deepseek-r1-0528`=15,
`grok-4`=15 · `mistral-large-2411`=11, `llama-3-70b`=9. Bands: 17–20 frontier, 14–16 strong
near-frontier open flagship, 11–13 solid mid, 8–10 small/older. Scores reflect benchmark standing
**relative to those anchors**, not absolute benchmark numbers.

## Reasoning by model

- **Opus 4.8** (orchestration + synthesis): commissioned the benchmark research, set the anchors,
  integrated both external reviews, made the final calls, and verified the disputed capability flags
  against OpenRouter's own `supported_parameters` (source data over prior intuition).
- **GPT-5.4** (benchmark-grounded): argued the 2026 open flagships were under-scored and the
  2025-era / non-reasoning models over-scored. Strongest calls: `mistral-large-2512` is a
  non-reasoning MoE (GPQA-D 48.6, LiveCodeBench 29.3) that benchmarks **below** Llama-4-Maverick, so
  its initial 13 was ~2 points high; `llama-4-maverick` (Apr-2025, weak coding) belongs near the
  `mistral-large-2411`=11 anchor, not with the 2026 flagships. Also flagged a stale "no OpenRouter
  model supports reasoning" README note. **Round-2 verdict: ship it.**
- **Gemini-3.5-Flash** (positional / structural): pushed back on the downgrades — a flagship should
  outrank its cheap tier and reflect generational improvement (wanted mistral-large=13, maverick=13,
  scout=11, gpt-oss-120b=14, nemotron-super=13) — and flagged the awkward `mistral-large == mistral-small`
  tie. **Round-2 verdict: ship it**; confirmed family monotonicity is clean.

## Synthesis — where the final numbers landed

- **Applied all 2026-flagship upgrades** (both reviewers agreed or didn't object): qwen3.7-max /
  kimi-k2.6 / glm-5.1 → 16; minimax-m3 / mimo-v2.5-pro → 15; deepseek-v4-flash → 14; qwen3.6-flash /
  minimax-m2.5 / mimo-v2.5 → 13; glm-4.7-flash → 12.
- **Split-the-difference where the reviewers bracketed a value:** `mistral-large-2512` = **12**
  (GPT 11 / Gemini 13; also resolves the large==small tie → large 12 > small 11) and
  `llama-4-maverick` = **12** (GPT 11 / Gemini 13); `llama-4-scout` = 10.
- **Sided with GPT-5.4 / the benchmarks** over Gemini's positional argument: `gpt-oss-120b` = 13
  (Aug-2025, GPQA-D 80.1) and `nemotron-3-super` = 12 (weak LiveCodeBench 31).
- **Overrode both reviewers on capability flags** after checking the source: kept
  `supports_extended_thinking=true` for the flash/small models (gemma-4, glm-4.7-flash, qwen3.6-flash,
  mimo-v2.5, nemotron-nano) because OpenRouter reports `reasoning=true` for them; kept the uncapped
  OR-served `max_output_tokens` (repo precedent: grok-4 256K/256K).

## Changes that landed

- **15 `intelligence_score` updates** (net: 2026 open flagships up, 2025-era / non-reasoning down).
- **3 context windows** corrected to the provider-**served** value (the catalog advertised the
  architectural max): minimax-m3 `1048576→524288`, llama-4-scout `10000000→327680`, nemotron-3-super
  `1000000→262144`.
- **De-staled** the "no OpenRouter model supports extended thinking" note in the `_README` field
  descriptions of all conf files (azure/xai/openai/gemini/openrouter) — now false (gpt-5.x,
  gemini-3.x, grok-4, and the open-weight models all advertise reasoning).

## Addendum — Ox Alpha (LiveBench-sourced, 2026-08)

`stealth/ox-alpha` is an **anonymous stealth model** on OpenRouter (appeared 2026-08-20; free ~1-week
preview; provider undisclosed, community fingerprinting suspects Z.ai/GLM). It has **no Artificial
Analysis or BenchLM coverage**, so unlike every other entry it is scored from **LiveBench**:
the LiveBench-2026-06-25 snapshot lists `ox-alpha-max` at **Overall 69.2** (Reasoning 76.6, Coding 75.8,
Math 77.5, Data 75.8, Language 66.1, Agentic Coding 52.6, Instruction Following 60.3).

Assigned `intelligence_score` = **15** — held one notch below the confirmed open flagships
(GLM-5.3/Kimi-K3/Qwen3.8-Max = 17, DeepSeek-V4-Pro = 16) because (a) the number comes from **LiveBench,
not the AA Index** the rest of the catalog is anchored to (different methodology — 69.2 is not directly
comparable to the AA-derived scores), and (b) it is an **unverified stealth preview** with weak
agentic/IF sub-scores. **Provisional** — revisit if the model de-cloaks or AA/BenchLM later list it.
